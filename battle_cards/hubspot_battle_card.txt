### 3. Our Winning Strategy (vs. hubspot):
*   **Superior Value at Pro Tier:** Position Tech Nova's Pro Tier as the clear winner for value. It's more affordable ($90/user/mo vs. HubSpot's $100/user/mo) and includes powerful features like the integrated "Nova AI" Co-pilot (AI Call Summaries & Email Drafting), Unlimited API Calls, and Unlimited automation workflows, which HubSpot's documents don't mention.
*   **Highlight AI-Powered Productivity:** Emphasize Tech Nova's built-in "Nova AI" Co-pilot as a key differentiator for boosting sales rep efficiency and productivity, a feature not explicitly offered by HubSpot in the provided context.
*   **Simplicity & Predictability:** Reinforce Tech Nova's mission as "powerful, simple, and predictable," offering a straightforward, all-in-one solution without hidden complexities, contrasting with HubSpot's potentially less transparent feature set at similar price points.
