Aggregated G2 Reviews for Zoho CRM (Nov 2025)
---------------------------------------------
What Users Like:
- "The power is unmatched. You can customize literally anything. If you have a weird business process, Zoho can handle it."
- "The value for the money is unbeatable. The Enterprise plan has features that HubSpot charges 5x the price for."
- "The Zoho One bundle is a game-changer. I run my entire business on Zoho."

What Users Dislike:
- "The UI feels 10 years old. It's clunky, complex, and not intuitive."
- "There's a steep learning curve. You can't just 'pick it up.' You need a dedicated admin or a consultant to set it up properly."
- "Integration between all the 'Zoho One' apps can be buggy and feel 'bolted together,' not seamless."
- "They will nickel-and-dime you. You need the 'Analytics' app for real reports, and the 'Desk' app for support, and 'Campaigns' for email... it gets complicated."
